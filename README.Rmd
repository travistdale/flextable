The flextable package provides a framework for easily create tables for reporting and publications. 
Tables can be embedded within:

* R Markdown documents with support for HTML, Word and PowerPoint documents.
* Microsoft Word or PowerPoint documents with package [officer](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/).
* PDF documents with package `pagedown`

Tables can also be rendered as R plots or graphic files (png, pdf and jpeg).

## Getting Started

An API is available to let R users create tables for reporting and control their formatting properties and their layout. A `flextable` object is a data.frame representation, it can be manipulated with functions that give control over:

- header, body and footer content 
- text, paragraphs, cells and border formatting of any element
- displayed values

There are articles on the flextable website that will help you get you to start quickly:

* [Introduction to flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/articles/overview.html)
* [Function reference](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/reference/index.html)

The help pages can be read [here](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable).

## Resources

### Online documentation

The help pages are located at https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/.

### Getting help

This project is developed and maintained on my own time. If you have
questions about how to use the package, visit Stackoverflow and use tags
`flextable` and `r` [Stackoverflow
link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flextable+r)\! I
usually read them and answer when possible. 

Don't send me a private emails to get free R support or to ask questions 
about using the package. They are systematically ignored except if you are 
French in which case I send you a commercial proposal :)

## Contributing to the package

### Code of Conduct

Anyone getting involved in this package agrees to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

### Bug reports

When you file a [bug report](https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable/issues),
please spend some time making it easy for me to follow and reproduce. The more
time you spend on making the bug report coherent, the more time I can dedicate
to investigate the bug as opposed to the bug report.

### Contributing to the package development

A great way to start is to contribute an example or improve the documentation.

If you want to submit a Pull Request to integrate functions of yours, please provide:

* the new function(s) with code and roxygen tags (with examples)
* a new section in the appropriate vignette that describes how to use the new function
* corresponding tests in directory `tests/testthat`.

By using rhub (run `rhub::check_for_cran()`), you will see if everything is ok.
When submitted, the PR will be evaluated automatically on travis and appveyor
and you will be able to see if something broke.
